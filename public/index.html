      <h2 class="science">Modeling color changes of peppered moths, a classic example of evolution, using a genetic algorithm</h2>

      <div id="tone-analysis">
       <p>In the early-1800's, peppered moths lived on lichen-covered birch trees and were white with black speckles, making them blend in with their environment. An all-black variant of the peppered moth was virtually unknown.</p>

       <p>After the industrial revolution, soot was pumped out into the atmosphere, changing the moths' habitat by making the trees dark and bare. Moths that were previously well camouflaged became easy prey, and the black variant of the moth began to thrive. Within a century, most of the moths in the region were black.</p>

       <p>As environmental regulations became more strict and the air was cleaned up, the trees became light again&mdash;and the moth population once again changed. Within decades, white peppered moths were abundant, and black ones were rare.</p>

       <p> class="explanation">This simulation demonstrates the effects of mutation and fitness advantage in achieving such rapid changes toward a highly camouflaged population.</p>

The Tone Analyzer Service helps people to understand three categories of tone scores: emotional tone, social tone, and language tone.
Each category has several sub-tones that the service scores. These tables describe each emotion or category,
and how to interpret the score the service returns for that emotion.
